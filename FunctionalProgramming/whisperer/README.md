# Whispers

This project will take a list of sentences and turn them into whispers.

## Basic Instructions
In [com.teamtreehouse.challenges.Main](src/main/java/com/teamtreehouse/challenges/Main.java),
there are *TODO*s to complete.  The program is setup so that you can run it to see the expected results.
There is an imperative version of the specific method of this challenge, and you need to write the declarative
approach.  Feel free to explore and make sure you are producing similar output.

When you are ready, run the Gradle task `treehouse > prepareSubmission` which will run tests and
zip up your code to a folder by the name of [submissions](submissions).  Upload this zip file
and when you get the tests passing.  **You got this!!!**

## This challenge
Take the sentences in the `whisperSentencesDeclaratively` in [Main.java](src/main/java/com/teamtreehouse/challenges/Main.java),
and print out the whispered version.  Use a method reference to the whisper method in your `forEach` method.
